- 👋 Hi, I’m @nyxarf
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot many technical and non-technical stuff. However I'd stick to speaking about my technical interests only since it's github, and it isn't rare for me to ramble about my non-technical interests, so here it is:
- -AI, ML, Data Analytics, CS, some robotics too!
- -languages: Java, C, C++, Python, JavaScript, R, SQL
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything that I've mentioned about, and much more. Aren't we all always learning?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on both frontend and backend related projects :-)
- 📫 How to reach me: wait can't we do that here itself?
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: i eat chocolate when i can't solve a problem, and the problem solves itself sooner.
